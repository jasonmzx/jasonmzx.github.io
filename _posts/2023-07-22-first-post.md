## Heavy inspired by Minnowo's Jekyll Site; "catfish"

I essentially forked it, and made my own changes *(Removed favicon, Edited navbar, Style tweaks, etc...)*<br>
**Link:** <a href="https://github.com/Minnowo/minnowo.github.io/tree/main">Minnowo.github.io's Source Repository</a>

**Link to Site** <a href="https://minnowo.github.io/2023/jekyll-deploy-struggle/">https://minnowo.github.io/2023/jekyll-deploy-struggle/</a> (VERY USEFUL LINK)


## NOTE:
 Make your `<username>.github.io` Repository on Github Website! <br> Initially I made it using the Linux `gh` pkg, and used `gh repo create jasonmzx.github.io` and it **DID NOT WORK** during production. *(GitHub Actions was choking)*

 After I re-created it on GitHub site, It auto-deployed immediately and worked like a charm!
