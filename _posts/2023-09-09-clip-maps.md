# My Notes & QnA on Clip-Mapping; Various Challenges & Techniques

Clip-mapping essentially optimizes the amount of Vertices ob Scene, rendered whilst still maintaining that effect of the "Open-World" going all the way to the Horizon.

The way you're able to see so far in the world is since the further you are from a place,Naturally the less detail you see... Obviously stuff just gets far, and we looks "Resolution" so to speak with our eyes, this kind of thing 
can be simulated with this technique; **Terrain Rendering Using GPU-Based Geometry Clipmaps**:

Essentially, at your player *(The Camera)* it will render the areas closest to you with the Finest Level of detail, as you get very close to this position in the open world.

Gradually as you look further out in the distance of the world, it renders a different level of detail, which is still the same map, but at a Coarser detail **(Divided by 2, each LOD for example)**

**LOD** : Level-of-Detail, Referred to as an Entire Layer of Various Detail Level, Example the LODs far away are very coarse. The LOD nearest to the player is the finest possible.

Notice how these **LOD**s form rings of detail arround the player so to speak, *Square-ish Rings* LOL

### Isn't it very expensive to dynamically simplify further away parts of the map, on the fly?

Yes, this in real-time would be computationally expensive, but given a known map, we can pre-compute all **LOD** Layers *(The entire map)* and just render the **Rings** at needed positions arround the Camera

#### ðŸ¤– GPT4's Input:

**Precomputed Levels:** Often, multiple LODs of the terrain are precomputed. This means the finer and coarser versions are already available, and the system just needs to select which one to render based on the distance from the camera. For example, a terrain patch might have a full-resolution mesh, a half-resolution mesh, a quarter-resolution mesh, etc. These are pre-generated and stored.


**Streaming and Caching:** Modern games and engines usually integrate LOD techniques with data streaming. The high-resolution data for distant terrains is not kept in memory but is streamed in as the player approaches. Meanwhile, coarser representations might be cached in memory for quick access.

### Between LODs , I'll have different "Levels" next to eachother, surely there will be some tearing !?!

Checkout the Discrepancies!

To solve this, **Transition Layers** are used to be, since in the Scene, we'll always know exactly where we LODs "seam" together. 

![Clip Map 3](/assets/custom/pictures/clip_map3.png)

So these **Transition Layers** Can be pre-computed aswell for every possible combination of Neighbouring LODs... That's **ALOT OF COMBOS !!!**

It also might be viable to just compute the transition layers on during run-time, might be an OK trade-off, to having **Game World Maps** being extremely space complex?

#### ðŸ¤– GPT4's Input:

**Pattern-based Transitions:** Instead of precomputing unique transition patterns for every possible scenario, developers can precompute patterns for the basic scenarios and reuse them. For instance, if you have 4 LOD levels, you'd primarily be concerned with transitions between LOD 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3. The specific pattern or stitching used to bridge between LOD 1 and 2, for example, can be reused wherever this transition occurs in the terrain. The patterns are a representation of how one LOD can transition to another, but they don't represent specific parts of the terrain.

**Dynamic Stitching:** Dynamic Stitching: Some engines employ methods to dynamically create the stitching between LOD levels at runtime. While this might incur a computational cost, it can save on memory and storage.

**Simplification of Farthest LODs:** At very distant LODs, where details are minuscule on screen, terrains can be vastly simplified. Such simplifications reduce the need for intricate transition patterns since the difference between two very distant LODs might be negligible. 

*So I can just really simple stitching algorithms, and with such a low vertex counter between the far LODs, It's gonna be fast asf!*

### When looking at further LOD Levels, how can I ensure that the general shape keeps it's "Character" Features from afar? 
(Example: Stoney Cliff Side Up close, But from afar it looks like a flat rock)

#### ðŸ¤– GPT4's Input:

This is one of the core challenges of LOD techniques: preserving the "character" or primary features of the original model as it's simplified. If not handled properly, the terrain or object can indeed look noticeably different, or even wrong, at lower LODs. This is especially true for features like a rocky cliff-side where the intricate details and silhouette contribute significantly to its appearance.

Here are some considerations and techniques related to this:

**Feature Preservation:** Advanced; simplification of mesh algorithms aim to preserve the primary features of the model. They don't just remove vertices arbitrarily. Instead, they prioritize vertices based on certain metrics (e.g., curvature, importance, visual saliency) to ensure that important features are preserved as long as possible.

**Normal Maps:** To retain the appearance of details without having them in geometry, games often use normal maps. Even when the geometry is simplified, the normal map can give the illusion of those details when rendering, especially when lighting is involved. So, a cliff might lose its intricate geometry at a distance, but a normal map could still provide the appearance of those rocky details.

**Dynamic & Continuous LOD (CLOD):** Some techniques don't use discrete LOD levels but adjust the mesh continuously based on various factors like distance, screen space error, etc. This can offer smoother transitions but might be more computationally intensive. | *NOT PRE-COMPUTED!*

**Adjusting by Hand:** In some cases, especially for crucial assets in a game, artists might manually adjust the lower LOD models to ensure they retain the desired appearance. While algorithms can do a lot, there's sometimes no substitute for the human touch.
